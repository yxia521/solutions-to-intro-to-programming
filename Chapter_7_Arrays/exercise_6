  You want to assign a new value to replace 'margaret', however, the 'margaret' is a string not integer. 
  When you try to refer to the index of 'margaret' here, you should type an integer.

  On line 2, the right code should be:
  names[3] = 'jody'

  Ruby will return names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'jody']
